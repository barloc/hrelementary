  - name: dbt_results
    description: |
      Run results of dbt invocations, inserted at the end of each invocation.
      Each row is the invocation result of a single resource (model, test, snapshot, etc).
      New data is loaded to this model on an on-run-end hook named 'hrelementary.on_run_end' from each invocation that produces a result object.
      This is an incremental model.
